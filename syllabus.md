### Course Description
In this course, we will focus on __big data analytics__, from a balanced theoretical and practical perspective. We will start with the _scope_, _role_, and _principles_ of big data in today’s business context, followed by two important pillars in big data analytics, namely __Distributed Computing__ and __Deep Learning__. These two pillars represent the latest development in the business analytics/data science domain.

In addition to the understanding of aforementioned two pillars, students are supposed to complete a comprehensive project, with either a research or a practical flavor of the project. The comprehensive project is used to test the capabilities and un-derstanding of all the knowledge in the domain – with a focus in any of the business domains (i.e. finance, accounting, marketing, etc.).

## Deliverables
### In-class Labs
8 labs have been set up for you to get hands-on experiences with big data analytics tools (please refer to course outlines – Page 5 for details). These tutorials are set up due to the hands-on nature of this course. The tutorials will cover all important aspects of this course, including distributed computing (Spark), deep learning and its applications (text analytics, computer vision, etc.). Submission guidelines: for some of labs, you will need to take screenshots of important steps in the lab, then copy and submit them in a MS Word document; for the rest of the labs, you should submit your IPython/Jupyter notebooks. Please follow the instructions closely in class. You will have until the next class meeting to submit your lab work (i.e. your first submission should be on 5/28 – by 6PM EST) – late submissions will __NOT be graded__.

### Course Project
There will be one (1) comprehensive and individual course project – which purpose is to assess your understanding of the topics and technologies discussed in this course. Note that the course project can be a part of your capstone project, if you are taking the capstone course in parallel - but you will need your faculty advisor for your capstone project to approve it.

You have to select following option for your course project:

1. Practical/Analytical project: you will conduct a real-world like data analytics project – from business understanding to evaluation/deployment of your model. You need to embed at least one (1) topic/technology discussed in this course in your course project.

With the course project, there are several required deliverables in this course:
1.	__Project Proposal__: specifying the project scope, expected outcome, responsibilities, and a possible time line of the project – this is supposed to be delivered in the form of in-class presentations (100 points) – please note that the proposal needs to be approved by the instructor before moving on with your project;
2.	__Progress Review/Milestone__: to be submitted in the pre-defined date (see Section 5 of this document for details) for the purpose of communicating progress and issues within the project (required, 0 points);
3.	__Final Presentation__: entailing the progress and achievements in the project, reviewing methods/techniques used in the project, and communicate with the instructor/client – the presentation will be completed in class (100 points);
4.	__Final Report/Deliverable__: depending on the selection of the project options, the final deliverable can be a written report (for theoretical/research project) or an analytical report/pipeline (for practical/analytical project) – the de-liverable will be used as the final assessment of the project, and this course (300 points).

### Deliverables Formatting Guidelines
Any Written report should be __typed__ in the form of a __single__ Microsoft Word/PDF document. Note that hand-written deliverable reports will __NOT__ be graded. The template for assignment report can be found in the course website (under “course contents”) – it is __REQUIRED__ to use the template for your assignment reports where applicable. Diagrams used in each report need to be created using graphical tool (i.e. Microsoft Visio, LucidChart). Hand-drawn diagrams will __NOT__ be graded. You should make use of them by submitting draft versions of the deliverables to me for feedbacks and comments – although they are not mandatory. Im-portant dates for these deliverables are illustrated in Page 5 of this document.

## Attendance and Class Participation

Learning will become much more informative and interesting through lively discussions and exchanges of ide-as/experiences during the class sessions. As such, students are expected to attend every class meeting. Successful class at-tendances, participations, and discussions, imply: 

__Attendance and Note Taking__: Attend each and every class in a timely manner. Be aware that some of the material dis-cussed in class will NOT be covered in the textbook, but will often appear in the exams. You will need to submit exer-cise files after most of the classes. Of course, I realize that in some cases unforeseeable emergencies arise. If you need to miss class for a legitimate, predictable reason, you must inform me and also take the initiative as early as possible to mitigate the effects of that absence. For example, you should establish a buddy system and ask another peer to take notes, handouts for you. You should find out what took place in the class prior to your next class attendance.

__Preparations__: To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing carefully all re-quired tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). Please take your own laptop – meeting the minimum hardware and software rquirements to every class meeting time – this is __mandatory__!


__Contributing in Class Discussions__: If you are in class and are well prepared, the next key step is to contribute ideas. While this may seem difficult at first, asking questions helps your classmates as well as you in clarifying concepts and overall understanding. Each of you will eventually be working in some organization where collaboration and discussions will be es-sential to problem solving in some business domain. Consider classroom discussion in the same spirit and participate!

__Respect and Dignity__: It is also important for each of us as individuals to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (I like to call this R&D). Listen carefully to the questions and comments while keeping an open mind for ideas. It is okay to disagree with certain viewpoints, but present your arguments in a courteous manner. Negative body lan-guage such as rolling your eyes, using phrases such as “that was a dumb idea”, or interrupting others to express disagreements runs counter to the spirit of positive learning environment and is not okay. At the end of the day, we would like to create a positive environment that is conducive to learning.

__Professionalism__: As budding professionals and business majors, conduct yourself in a professional manner just as you would with an employer or colleague. Refrain for unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late to class, coming in and out of class, taking a nap in class, making unprofessional comments to other students and the instructor, and sending unprofes-sional comments. Out of respect for fellow students, all mobile communication and entertainment devices need to be turned off and kept off during the class. Only software tools required for the class (e.g. SPSS Modeler) or note taking software (e.g., Evernote) the class time.

---

## Other Course Policies

__Computer and Lab__: You will have to bring in a laptop for every class in order to complete the in-class tutorials. It is your responsibility to make sure that your laptop is up-to-date so that it runs the system smoothly. You will need to have access to a Jupyter environment to complete the course work - fail to do so will lead to failing the course.

__Course Materials__: All the teaching materials, including assignments and exams, are the intellectual properties of Fair-ield University – distributing such materials without written approval is strongly prohibited.

__Late Submissions__: Grades become official one week after assignments/exams have been returned by the instructor. Late submissions will __NOT__ be graded.  No make-up opportunities would be given to final deliverables of both competitions/projects.

__Email Communications and Feedbacks__: When sending an email to your instructor, please include in your email your section name or the time you are taking the class (i.e., using “IS550  + your name” in the subject line). Normally, I would reply to your email no longer than __24__ hours. I will not respond to emails sending from/to non-university emails. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. Special Note: Throughout this course, I will use my student email address (jtao@student.fairfield.edu) to share course files with you – however, ALL course related communications should be referred to my main email (jtao@fairfield.edu).

__Academic Honesty__: Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself.

__Students with Disabilities__: Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights and privileges of its services, programs and activities, in an accessible setting. Fur-thermore, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, we provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students, to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities.
