### Course Description
In this course, we will focus on __big data analytics__, from a balanced theoretical and practical perspective. We will start with the _scope_, _role_, and _principles_ of big data in today’s business context, followed by two important pillars in big data analytics, namely __Distributed Computing__ and __Deep Learning__. These two pillars represent the latest development in the business analytics/data science domain.

In addition to the understanding of aforementioned two pillars, students are supposed to complete a comprehensive project, with either a research or a practical flavor of the project. The comprehensive project is used to test the capabilities and un-derstanding of all the knowledge in the domain – with a focus in any of the business domains (i.e. finance, accounting, marketing, etc.).
